protograf: Table of Contents
==============================

The **protograf** documentation consists of the primary sections listed
below.

Although its great to be able to just "jump in" and start using a
program, the sections below are designed to be read in order - apart from
the terminology - as they all contain useful information and build on each
other.

1.  `Overview <overview.rst>`_ - a brief introduction of the purpose and
    rationale of **protograf**
2.  `Setting Up <setting_up.rst>`_ - how to get **protograf** working
    on your computer
3.  `Basic Concepts <basic_concepts.rst>`_ - core aspects of
    **protograf** that you **must** know
4.  `A First Example <worked_example.rst>`_ - step-by-step
    example of setting up and running a script to generate a deck of cards
5.  `Script Anatomy <script_anatomy.rst>`_ - how a script is constructed
6.  `Additional Concepts <additional_concepts.rst>`_ - additional
    aspects of **protograf** that can also help with script creation
7.  `Core Shapes <core_shapes.rst>`_ - a tour of the core geometries
    available and how to construct and customise them
8.  `Card Decks <card_decks.rst>`_ - how to create a deck, or set, of
    cards/tiles
9.  `Advanced Commands <advanced_commands.rst>`_ - how to work with
    common/reused items and repetitive elements
10. `Customised Shapes <customised_shapes.rst>`_ - how to refine the
    appearance of certain shapes; circles, hexagons and rectangles
11. `Layouts <layouts.rst>`_ - how to work with different kinds of
    layouts (repeats, sequences, tracks and rectangular grids)
12. `Hexagonal Grids <hexagonal_grids.rst>`_ - how to create different types
    of hexagonal grids and customise or add to them
13. `Terminology <terminology.rst>`_ - summary of common jargon and descriptions
    of many of the elements' properties
14. `Commands <commands.rst>`_ - summary of all the commands available

The following are supplementary sections that you're likely to need when
doing more advanced scripts or needing further resources:

15. `Descriptions of Supplied Examples <examples/index.rst>`_ - brief
    walkthoughs of many of the examples provided with **protograf**
16. `Using Python Commands <python_commands.rst>`_ - how to work with
    *loops*, *if/then* statements and *functions* for more flexibility
17. `Development Notes <development.rst>`_ - notes for programmers wanting
    to develop further in or with  **protograf**
18. `Useful Resources <useful_resources.rst>`_ - links to
    tools and websites related to boardgame prototyping

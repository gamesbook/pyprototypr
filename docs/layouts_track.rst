Track Command
=============

**pyprototypr** allows you to directly define where elements, that make up
your design, should be placed within a page, or over a series of pages
within a `deck <card_decks.rst>`_, but it also includes commands that let you
place, or "`layout <layouts.rst>`_", elements in a more repetitive or regular
way within a page.

This section assumes you are very familiar with the concepts, terms and ideas
for **pyprototypr** as presented in `Basic Concepts <basic_concepts.rst>`_ ,
that you understand all of the `Additional Concepts <additional_concepts.rst>`_
and that you've created some basic scripts of your own using the
`Core Shapes <core_shapes.rst>`_.

- `TriangularLocations <layouts_triangular.rst>`_

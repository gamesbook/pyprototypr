Unicode Characters
==================

There are thousands of symbols that are potentially of use in a prototype
design.

For game design, the character sets from U+2000 (General Punctuation) to
U+2BFF (Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows) are likely to be of interest.
**Note** that not all Unicode characters can be displayed in all fonts!

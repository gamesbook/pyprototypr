Discussion of Examples
======================

The examples supplied with **pyprototypr** attempt to highlight or
demonstrate how different functions or features can be used. They are
do **not** attempt to be comprehensive and cover all features, but they
do give some ideas as to what can be done - and how.

In most cases, you need to look at the source code to understand how the
output has been created.

1. `Demo <demo.rst>`_ - a quick, somewhat random, tour of various
   elements in **pyprototypr**
2. `Simple <simple.rst>`_ - concrete examples of elements in both basic
   and customised form
3. `Cards <cards.rst>`_ - different kinds of decks that can be
   constructed
4. `Counters <counters.rst>`_ - counters are really just "tiny square
   cards"!
5. `Abstract Boards <abstract.rst>`_ and
   `Commercial Boards <commercial.rst>`_ - construction examples for games
6. `BGG <bgg.rst>`_ - how to retrieve and display data that can be
   accessed from the BoardGameGeek API
7. `Various <various.rst>`__ - examples of miscellaneous "real world" objects;
   usually constructed using multiple different elements from **pyprototypr**

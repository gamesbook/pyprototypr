Source Code `<https://github.com/gamesbook/pyprototypr/blob/master/examples/boards/commercial/squad_leader.py>`_
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion  This example shows how to construct a board for a wargame - in
            this Avalon Hill's "Squad Leader" - using a hexagonal grid.

            The grid's properties, such as alphanumeric coordinates and hex
            column offsets are used for overall appearance; the use of a blank
            white rectangle enables the  "half-hex" effect at the lower edge
            of the board.

Source Code `<https://github.com/gamesbook/pyprototypr/blob/master/examples/boards/commercial/orion_game_board.py>`_
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion  This example shows how to construct a board for the commercial
            board game "Orion".  It is a fairly simple script, as the board
            is similar to many abstract boards; a so-called "hexhex" shape.

            The background is just stacked ``Circle`` s of differing fill colors
            and the main board is a ``HexagonalGrid`` of ``circular`` shape.
            Of interest is that the "corner" hexagons are not displayed because
            they are listed as *masked*.

----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Source Code `<https://github.com/gamesbook/pyprototypr/blob/master/examples/boards/commercial/ack_map.py>`_
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion  This example shows how to construct a blank map for the
            "Adventurer Conqueror King" roleplaying game.

            The map is constructed of two hexagonal grids; the larger hexes
            have fill set to ``None`` so that the small hexes are visible
            through it. The use of white rectangles enables the  "half-hex"
            effect at the lower edge of the board.

Title       *Traveller RPG Map*
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Source Code `<https://github.com/gamesbook/pyprototypr/blob/master/examples/boards/commercial/traveller_draft.py>`_
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion  This example shows how to construct a blank sector map for the
            "Traveller" roleplaying game.

            Its a simple hexagonal grid, with a numeric coordinate system.
            The "edges" are just drawn with lines.

            It might be possible, in future, to expand this to show how star
            systems could be depicted on it; something along the lines of the
            Warp War`_ example.

Source Code `<https://github.com/gamesbook/pyprototypr/blob/master/examples/boards/commercial/traveller_black.py>`_
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion  This example shows how to construct a blank sector map for the
            "Traveller" roleplaying game.

            Its a simple hexagonal grid, with a numeric coordinate system.
            The "edges" are just drawn with lines. The styling is black because
            of the fill used for the hexagons; when testing, however, it could
            be better to use a lighter color as this much black is not very
            "print friendly".

            It might be possible, in future, to expand this to show how star
            systems could be depicted on it; something along the lines of the
            `Warp War`_ example.

Warp War

=========== ==================================================================
Title       *Warp War Map*
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Source Code `<https://github.com/gamesbook/pyprototypr/blob/master/examples/boards/commercial/warpwar.py>`_
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion  This example shows how to construct a map for the "Warp War" game.
            Its based off an image created by Rick Smith and posted to the
            https://groups.io/g/warpwar/ forum on 3 June 2024.  This is *not*
            a complete copy of that map - it just serves to illustrate how
            elements of such a map could be created.

            This is a fairly complex layout as most items need to be placed
            with millimetre accuracy using the ``Location()`` command to detail
            which shapes go into which hexagon grid location.

            The green lines joining hexagons are created with the ``LinkLine()``
            command; by default this joins the centres of two locations in the
            hexagon grid; but use of the optional "move x" and "move y"
            settings allows the line endpoints to be adjusted within their
            respective hexagons.

            The use of hexagon ``borders`` enables the drawing of purple lines
            which represent the edges of a nebula; unfortunately, its quite
            tedious to define all of these one-by-one!

            The hexagon numbering for this game, which  **pyprototypr** terms
            ``diagonal`` is fairly unusual.

            The hexagon identifers across the top and side are created with a
            ``Sequence(`` command; they are not "built-in" to the grid.  Not
            many games seem to use these, or use them in quite different ways,
            so there is currently no automated way of doing this.

Underwater Cities

Title       *Underwater Cities Game Board*
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Source Code `<https://github.com/gamesbook/pyprototypr/blob/master/examples/boards/commercial/underwater_cities.py>`_
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion  This example shows how to construct the board for the commercial
            board game "Underwater Cities". This is *not* a complete copy of
            that board - it just serves to illustrate how elements of it could
            be created during the prototyping stage.

            The script for this example is one of the longest but it is not
            really that complex, as most shapes are simple rectangles stacked
            in the correct order, with the right fill and line color & styling.

            Some items of interest:

            - Extensive use of the ``Common()`` command to avoid duplication
              between similar items
            - Use of an SVG world map to create the background layer
            - Mix of custom images, free icons and **pyprototypr** to create
              the smaller graphic elements
            - Use of the ``RectangularLocation()`` command to layout the
              scoring track; the ``Layout()`` command makes use of multiple
              repeating shapes for the color changes at different intervals
            - Use of ``Sequence()`` command to create the player order track,
              (in the middle) as well as the different rounds (on the right)

complex - concepts and options in `protograf <index.rst>`_ - its
therefore important that you are familiar with all of the
`Basic Concepts <basic_concepts.rst>`_, have looked through the
`Core Shapes <core_shapes.rst>`_, have understood how these are used via
the various examples, and are therefore comfortable with creating and using
scripts.

**protograf** allows you to place elements that make up your design
anywhere within a page, or over a series of pages within a deck, but it

more repetitive or regular way within a page.

The different kinds of layouts are described in the section on
`layouts <layouts.rst>`_.

Subsets of Games
----------------

You can retrieve a subset of games by providing one or more items to match on.

These are:

- *own* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) owned items
- *rated* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) rated items
- *played* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) played items
- *commented* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) items commented on
- *trade* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) items for trade
- *want* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) items wanted in trade
- *wishlist* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) items in the wishlist
- *preordered* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) preordered items
- *want_to_play* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) items wanting to play
- *want_to_buy* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) items wanting to buy
- *prev_owned* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) previously owned items
- *has_parts* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) items for which there is a comment in the "Has parts" field
- *want_parts* -  include (if ``True``) or exclude (if ``False``) items for which there is a comment in the "Want parts" field

These are added as properties to the ``BGG()`` command. For example:

.. code:: python

    bgames = BGG(
        user='BenKenobi1976',
        own=True,
        want_to_play=True,
    )

In this example, games must be marked both as "want to play" items **and**
items that are "own"ed for the user ``BenKenobi1976``.

Welcome to protograf's documentation!
=====================================

The **protograf** documentation consists of the primary sections listed
below.

Although its great to be able to just "jump in" and start using a
program, the sections below are designed to be read in order - apart from
the terminology - as they all contain useful information and build on each
other.

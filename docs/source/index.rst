Welcome to protograf's documentation!
=====================================

The `protograf <https://github.com/gamesbook/protograf>`_  documentation consists
of the sections listed below.

Although its great to be able to just "jump in" and start using a
program, the sections below are designed to be read in order - apart from
the terminology - as they all contain useful information and build on each
other.

If its your first time here, please consult the `guide <guide.html>`_ to get
a sense of what is contained in these different sections.

Outline
=======
`↑ <table-of-contents_>`_

There are four parts to being able to use :doc:`protograf <index>`
on your own machine:

1. Install the correct version of `Python <http://www.python.org>`_
2. Install and set-up **protograf**
3. Install a text editing program
4. Install a PDF viewer (e.g. *Adobe Acrobat*)

Its possible that you may already have one or more of these programs installed.


Python in 1 minute
==================
`↑ <table-of-contents_>`_

Why do you need Python before starting?

When you work with Python, you do not create executable files, such as the
typical `.exe` ones you find on Windows (or `.app` on macOS). Instead, Python
itself is loaded and then it "runs" your Python file/script (the `.py` ones)
on your behalf.  So, running any Python scripts requires that you first install
Python itself.

Python is composed of many built-in libaries, or *packages*, each of which
handles some aspect of a program. Python is designed to be extended by adding
on additional packages written by other programmers; ``ReportLab``, for example,
is one of those, as is **protograf**.  Python does not come with those packages
built-in - you need to install them after Python itself has been installed.

Installing Python packages is handled by a tool called ``pip``, which is typically
installed at the same time as Python itself.


Installing Python
=================
`↑ <table-of-contents_>`_

**protograf** requires a device e.g. laptop or desktop (but probably
not a smart phone) that already has the correct version of Python
(version 3.13 or higher) installed.

Linux users
-----------

You likely already have a version of Python installed.  To setup a new virtual
environment, you can use a modern tool such as `uv`; see
https://ubuntushell.com/install-uv-python-package-manager/

You can then use `uv` to install an updated version of Python as well as this
virtual environment; for example::

    uv venv --python 3.13

New packages can be installed using `uv` and `pip`::

    uv pip install reportlab

`uv` has extensive documentation at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

Windows and mac Users
---------------------

If you have no experience of working with Python, then "miniconda" is a fairly
simple way of using Python; follow
https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/ for instructions on
downloading and running the installer. Make sure you choose a version that will
install Python 3.13 or higher (3.13, 3.14, etc.).  Again, follow the
documentation there to ensure that Python is working after the installation
is complete.

Once Python is installed and working, you can install new packages for it using
``pip``.

Alternative Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another very detailed and useful guide to installing Python on Windows is at:
https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/install-python-on-windows-10-and-11

This guide will also take you through installing
`NotePad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_ which is the recommended
Windows editor for creating **protograf** scripts.

For MacOS, there is a helpful guide on working with Python from
*pyLadies*; see:
http://www.pyladies.com/blog/Get-Your-Mac-Ready-for-Python-Programming/

Test that Python is installed
-----------------------------

In order to test that Python is installed, start a **command-line
window**. The way you do this depends on your operating system.

-  For Windows users - go to "Start -> Run" (On Windows 7 to 10, press
   "WindowsKey+R" or use the search box at the bottom of the Start menu)

-  For Mac OS X users - go to your Applications/Utilities folder and
   choose "Terminal".

-  For Linux users; you should already know how to open a Terminal!

When the command-line window appears, type::

   python --version

You should see something like::

   Python 3.13.1

The exact number after the "13" does not matter.

You can now close the command-line window.


Other Software Installs
=======================
`↑ <table-of-contents_>`_

PDF Viewer
----------

You will also need a program that can display PDF files; for example,
*Adobe Acrobat* (cross-platform), or **Evince** (Linux), or **Preview**
(Mac), or **Foxit** (Windows). Most modern web browsers should also be
able to open and display PDF files.

Core Fonts (optional)
---------------------

For Linux users, it is recommended that you install Microsoft’s Core
Fonts - see http://mscorefonts2.sourceforge.net/ - Ubuntu users can
install these via::

   sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer


Installing **protograf**
==========================
`↑ <table-of-contents_>`_

The simplest way to install **protograf** itself is via ``pip``.

Open a command-line window (see the section `Test that Python is installed`_)
and::

   pip install protograf


Checking if **protograf** works
=================================
`↑ <table-of-contents_>`_

To now check that ``protograf`` works, you should create a small test
file.

Open your text editor and type - or copy and paste - the following (
but do not start any line with spaces!)::

   from protograf import *
   Create()
   Text(text="Hello World")
   Save()

Save the file; call it something like *test.py*. (The ".py" indicates
its a Python file - this is useful but not essential).

Now use Python to "run" this file.

By "run", its meant that you open a command-line window (see the section
`Test that Python is installed`_), change to the directory in which the
test file was created, for example on Windows::

   cd C:/

and then type::

   python test.py

and press the *Enter* key. Note that you should replace ``test.py`` with
the actual name of the file you created.

There should now be a new file called ``test.pdf`` in the same
directory.

You should be able to open and view this PDF file via your PDF viewer.
It should be a mostly blank page with the phrase *Hello World* near the
bottom-left.


Python in the cloud
===================
`↑ <table-of-contents_>`_

If you do not want to install Python, you can try a cloud-based version.

You will need to register on this site: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ and
use the tools and infrastructure they provide.

    **NOTE** The environment used for `pythonanywhere` is a Linux-based one
    and likely unfamiliar if you're a Windows user - especially if you're not
    used to working via a "shell" in a terminal, or command-line, interface.

*pythonanywhere* provides a terminal (`bash`) that you can use to install Python
packages via `pip` and the option to upload files - such as **protograf**
scripts. Once scripts are uploaded there, they can be run in the terminal.

*pythonanywhere* has its own documentation to help you work further with it.

Discussion of Examples
======================

The examples supplied with `protograf <../index.rst>`_  attempt to highlight
or demonstrate how different functions or features can be used. They are
do **not** attempt to be comprehensive and cover all features, but they
do give some ideas as to what can be done - and how.

In most cases, you will need to look at the source code to understand how the
output has been created.

1. There is a somewhat random tour of various elements in **protograf**
   available as a `PDF file <https://github.com/gamesbook/protograf/blob/master/docs/examples/demo.pdf>`_ - it is based on the
   `demo script <https://github.com/gamesbook/protograf/blob/master/examples/core/demo.py>`_
2. `Abstract Boards <abstract.rst>`_ and
   `Commercial Boards <commercial.rst>`_ - construction examples for games
3. `Counters <counters.rst>`_ - counters are really just "tiny square
   cards"!
4. `Cards <cards.rst>`_ - different kinds of decks that can be
   constructed
5. `BGG <bgg.rst>`_ - how to retrieve and display data that can be
   accessed from the BoardGameGeek API
6. `Various <various.rst>`__ - examples of miscellaneous "real world" objects;
   usually constructed using multiple different elements of **protograf**
